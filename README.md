# Booklist-Program
I have created a booklist class where one can: 1.  add a book at the end of the list, 2. add a book at any location, 3. find a book by ISBN number (binary search), 4. find a book by ISBN number (linear search), 5. delete a book from a location, 6. delete a book by ISBN number, 7. sort the list (selection sort), 8. sort the list (bubble sort), and 9. print the list.
